### My Developer Take-aways
This development project was tricky because I was transferring web development skills to mobile. As a cross-platform technology, React Native was perfect to handle these challenges. 
<br /> 
<br />
Research into the typical features of mobile apps (accessibilty, chat UI design, etc.) and User Stories helped significantly to guide the development process and determine which features were top priority. 

#### User Stories 
<ol>
<li>As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.</li>
<li>As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.</li>
</ol>
